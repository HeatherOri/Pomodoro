<h3>POMODORO Timer</h3>
          <p>
            The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system that encourages
            people to work with the time they haveâ€”rather than against it. Using
            this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated
            by five-minute breaks. These intervals are referred to as pomodoros.
